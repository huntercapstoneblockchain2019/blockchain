# blockchain
We will recreate a blockchain for a library management system from scratch. 

In order to run the program please download flask and run the following:

` export FLASK_APP=server.py`
` flask run`

If you get an error stating:
 `ImportError: No module named 'library'` 
 simply type and run:
 `export PYTHONPATH=.`
